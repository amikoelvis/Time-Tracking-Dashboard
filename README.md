# Frontend Mentor - Time Tracking Dashboard

This is a solution to the [Time Tracking Dashboard challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/time-tracking-dashboard-UIQ7167Jw). The project is a responsive dashboard displaying time spent on activities (Work, Play, Study, etc.) with toggleable Daily, Weekly, and Monthly views, defaulting to Monthly.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox and CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I Learned

I learned to implement a responsive layout with Tailwind CSS, using `flex md:flex-col` for mobile-to-desktop transitions and JavaScriptâ€™s `showTimeframe('monthly')` for the HTML version. Left-aligning buttons with `text-left w-full` improved readability:

### Continued development

I plan to add accessibility with aria-pressed for buttons and dynamic data via JSON fetching to replace hardcoded values. Enhancing UX with CSS transitions for timeframe switching is also a goal.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - This helped me with the styling.
- [Using data attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/How_to/Use_data_attributes) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand using data attribute. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
